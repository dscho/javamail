<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

An IMAP protocol provider for the JavaMail API
that provides access to an IMAP message store.
Both the IMAP4 and IMAP4rev1 protocols are supported.
Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2060.txt" TARGET="_top">
RFC 2060</A>
for more information.
<P>
The IMAP protocol provider can use SASL
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2222</A>)
authentication mechanisms on systems that support the
<CODE>javax.security.sasl</CODE> APIs, such as J2SE 5.0.
In addition to the SASL mechanisms that are built into 
the SASL implementation, users can also provide additional
SASL mechanisms of their own design to support custom authentication
schemes.  See the
<A HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/sasl/sasl-refguide.html" TARGET="_top">
Java SASL API Programming and Deployment Guide</A> for details.
Note that the current implementation doesn't support SASL mechanisms
that provide their own integrity or confidentiality layer.
<P>
A connected IMAPStore maintains a pool of IMAP protocol objects for
use in communicating with the IMAP server. The IMAPStore will create
the initial AUTHENTICATED connection and seed the pool with this
connection. As folders are opened and new IMAP protocol objects are
needed, the IMAPStore will provide them from the connection pool,
or create them if none are available. When a folder is closed,
its IMAP protocol object is returned to the connection pool if the
pool is not over capacity.
<P>
A mechanism is provided for timing out idle connection pool IMAP
protocol objects. Timed out connections are closed and removed (pruned)
from the connection pool.
<P>
The connected IMAPStore object may or may not maintain a separate IMAP
protocol object that provides the store a dedicated connection to the
IMAP server. This is provided mainly for compatibility with previous
implementations of the IMAP protocol provider.
<P>
The IMAP protocol provider supports the following properties,
which may be set in the JavaMail <code>Session</code> object.
The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes
how the string is interpreted.  For example, use
<PRE>
	props.put("mail.imap.port", "888");
</PRE>
to set the <CODE>mail.imap.port</CODE> property, which is of type int.
<P>
Note that if you're using the "imaps" protocol to access IMAP over SSL,
all the properties would be named "mail.imaps.*".

<TD>The IMAP server to connect to.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.port</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>The IMAP server port to connect to, if the connect() method doesn't
explicitly specify one. Defaults to 143.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.partialfetch</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>Controls whether the IMAP partial-fetch capability should be used.
Defaults to true.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.fetchsize</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>Partial fetch size in bytes. Defaults to 16K.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.ignorebodystructuresize</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>The IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE response includes the exact size of each body part.
Normally, this size is used to determine how much data to fetch for each
body part.
Some servers report this size incorrectly in some cases; this property can
be set to work around such server bugs.
If this property is set to true, this size is ignored and data is fetched
until the server reports the end of data.
This will result in an extra fetch if the data size is a multiple of the
block size.
Defaults to false.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.connectiontimeout</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>Socket connection timeout value in milliseconds.
Default is infinite timeout.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.timeout</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>Socket I/O timeout value in milliseconds.  Default is infinite timeout.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.statuscachetimeout</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>Timeout value in milliseconds for cache of STATUS command response.
Default is 1000 (1 second).  Zero disables cache.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.appendbuffersize</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>
Maximum size of a message to buffer in memory when appending to an IMAP
folder.  If not set, or set to -1, there is no maximum and all messages
are buffered.  If set to 0, no messages are buffered.  If set to (e.g.)
8192, messages of 8K bytes or less are buffered, larger messages are
not buffered.  Buffering saves cpu time at the expense of short term
memory usage.  If you commonly append very large messages to IMAP
mailboxes you might want to set this to a moderate value (1M or less).
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.connectionpoolsize</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>Maximum number of available connections in the connection pool.
Default is 1.</TD>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.allowreadonlyselect</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>If false, attempts to open a folder read/write will fail
if the SELECT command succeeds but indicates that the folder is READ-ONLY.
This sometimes indicates that the folder contents can'tbe changed, but
the flags are per-user and can be changed, such as might be the case for
public shared folders.  If true, such open attempts will succeed, allowing
the flags to be changed.  The <code>getMode</code> method on the
<code>Folder</code> object will return <code>Folder.READ_ONLY</code>
in this case even though the <code>open</code> method specified
<code>Folder.READ_WRITE</code>.  Default is false.</TD>

If set to "*", all hosts are trusted.
If set to a whitespace separated list of hosts, those hosts are trusted.
Otherwise, trust depends on the certificate the server presents.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.ssl.socketFactory</TD>
<TD>SSLSocketFactory</TD>
<TD>
If set to a class that extends the

<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>If true, enables the use of the <code>STARTTLS</code> command (if
supported by the server) to switch the connection to a TLS-protected
connection before issuing any login commands.  Note that an appropriate
trust store must configured so that the client will trust the server's
certificate.  This feature only works on J2SE 1.4 and newer systems.
Default is false.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.starttls.required</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.minidletime</TD>
<TD>int</TD>
<TD>
Applications typically call the idle method in a loop.  If another
thread termiantes the IDLE command, it needs a chance to do its
work before another IDLE command is issued.  The idle method enforces
a delay to prevent thrashing between the IDLE command and regular
commands.  This property sets the delay in milliseconds.  If not
set, the default is 10 milliseconds.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.enableimapevents</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Enable special IMAP-specific events to be delivered to the Store's
<code>ConnectionListener</code>.  If true, unsolicited responses
received during the Store's <code>idle</code> method will be sent
as <code>ConnectionEvent</code>s with a type of
<code>IMAPStore.RESPONSE</code>.  The event's message will be the
raw IMAP response string.
By default, these events are not sent.
NOTE: This capability is highly experimental and likely will change
in future releases.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.imap.folder.class</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
Class name of a subclass of <code>com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPFolder</code>.

The subclass must have public constructors of the form
<code>public MyIMAPFolder(String fullName, char separator, IMAPStore store,
Boolean isNamespace)</code> and
<code>public MyIMAPFolder(ListInfo li, IMAPStore store)</code>
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
In general, applications should not need to use the classes in this
package directly.  Instead, they should use the APIs defined by
<code>javax.mail</code> package (and subpackages).  Applications should
never construct instances of <code>IMAPStore</code> or
<code>IMAPFolder</code> directly.  Instead, they should use the
<code>Session</code> method <code>getStore</code> to acquire an
appropriate <code>Store</code> object, and from that acquire
<code>Folder</code> objects.
<P>
In addition to printing debugging output as controlled by the
{@link javax.mail.Session Session} configuration,
the com.sun.mail.imap provider logs the same information using
{@link java.util.logging.Logger} as described in the following table:
