<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

An SMTP protocol provider for the JavaMail API
that provides access to an SMTP server.
Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc821.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 821</A>
for more information.
<P>
When sending a message, detailed information on each address that
fails is available in an
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressFailedException SMTPAddressFailedException}
chained off the top level
{@link javax.mail.SendFailedException SendFailedException}
that is thrown.
In addition, if the <code>mail.smtp.reportsuccess</code> property
is set, an
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressSucceededException
SMTPAddressSucceededException}
will be included in the list for each address that is successful.
Note that this will cause a top level
{@link javax.mail.SendFailedException SendFailedException}
to be thrown even though the send was successful.
<P>
The SMTP provider also supports ESMTP
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1651.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1651</A>).
It can optionally use SMTP Authentication 
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2554.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2554</A>)
using the LOGIN, PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5, and NTLM mechanisms
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2595.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2595</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2831</A>).
<P>
To use SMTP authentication you'll need to set the <code>mail.smtp.auth</code>
property (see below) or provide the SMTP Transport
with a username and password when connecting to the SMTP server.  You
can do this using one of the following approaches:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Provide an Authenticator object when creating your mail Session
and provide the username and password information during the
Authenticator callback.
<P>
Note that the <code>mail.smtp.user</code> property can be set to provide a
default username for the callback, but the password will still need to be
supplied explicitly.
<P>
This approach allows you to use the static Transport <code>send</code> method
to send messages.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
Call the Transport <code>connect</code> method explicitly with username and
password arguments.
<P>
This approach requires you to explicitly manage a Transport object
and use the Transport <code>sendMessage</code> method to send the message.
The transport.java demo program demonstrates how to manage a Transport
object.  The following is roughly equivalent to the static
Transport <code>send</code> method, but supplies the needed username and
password:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Transport tr = session.getTransport("smtp");
tr.connect(smtphost, username, password);
msg.saveChanges();	// don't forget this
tr.sendMessage(msg, msg.getAllRecipients());
tr.close();
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
When using DIGEST-MD5 authentication,
you'll also need to supply an appropriate realm;
your mail server administrator can supply this information.
You can set this using the <code>mail.smtp.sasl.realm</code> property,
or the <code>setSASLRealm</code> method on <code>SMTPTransport</code>.
<P>
The SMTP protocol provider can use SASL
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2222</A>)
authentication mechanisms on systems that support the
<CODE>javax.security.sasl</CODE> APIs, such as J2SE 5.0.
In addition to the SASL mechanisms that are built into 
the SASL implementation, users can also provide additional
SASL mechanisms of their own design to support custom authentication
schemes.  See the
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/sasl/sasl-refguide.html" TARGET="_top">
Java SASL API Programming and Deployment Guide</A> for details.
Note that the current implementation doesn't support SASL mechanisms
that provide their own integrity or confidentiality layer.
<P>
SMTP can also optionally request Delivery Status Notifications
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1891.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1891</A>).
The delivery status will typically be reported using
a "multipart/report"
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1892.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1892</A>)
message type with a "message/delivery-status"
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1894.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1894</A>)
part.
You can use the classes in the {@link com.sun.mail.dsn} package to
handle these MIME types.
Note that you'll need to include <code>dsn.jar</code> in your CLASSPATH
as this support is not included in <code>mail.jar</code>.
<P>
See below for the properties to enable these features.
<P>
Note also that <strong>THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION HERE TO USE THESE
FEATURES!!!</strong>  You will need to read the appropriate RFCs mentioned above
to understand what these features do and how to use them.  Don't just
start setting properties and then complain to us when it doesn't work
like you expect it to work.  <strong>READ THE RFCs FIRST!!!</strong>
<P>
The SMTP protocol provider supports the following properties,
which may be set in the JavaMail <code>Session</code> object.
The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes
how the string is interpreted.  For example, use
<PRE>
	props.put("mail.smtp.port", "888");
</PRE>
to set the <CODE>mail.smtp.port</CODE> property, which is of type int.
<P>
Note that if you're using the "smtps" protocol to access SMTP over SSL,
all the properties would be named "mail.smtps.*".

even if all addresses were correct and the message was sent
successfully.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.socketFactory</TD>
<TD>SocketFactory</TD>
<TD>
If set to a class that implements the

<TD>
If true, enables the use of the <code>STARTTLS</code> command (if
supported by the server) to switch the connection to a TLS-protected
connection before issuing any login commands.  Note that an appropriate
trust store must configured so that the client will trust the server's
certificate.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.starttls.required</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If true, requires the use of the <code>STARTTLS</code> command.

fails, the connect method will fail.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.socks.host</TD>
<TD>string</TD>
<TD>
Specifies the host name of a SOCKS5 proxy server that will be used for
connections to the mail server.
(Note that this only works on JDK 1.5 or newer.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.socks.port</TD>
<TD>string</TD>
<TD>
Specifies the port number for the SOCKS5 proxy server.
This should only need to be used if the proxy server is not using
the standard port number of 1080.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.mailextension</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
Extension string to append to the MAIL command.
The extension string can be used to specify standard SMTP
service extensions as well as vendor-specific extensions.
Typically the application should use the
{@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport SMTPTransport}
method {@link com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport#supportsExtension
supportsExtension}
to verify that the server supports the desired service extension.
See <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1869.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 1869</A>
and other RFCs that define specific extensions.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.userset</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, use the RSET command instead of the NOOP command
in the {@link javax.mail.Transport#isConnected isConnected} method.
In some cases sendmail will respond slowly after many NOOP commands;
use of RSET avoids this sendmail issue.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.smtp.noop.strict</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true (the default), insist on a 250 response code from the NOOP
command to indicate success.  The NOOP command is used by the
{@link javax.mail.Transport#isConnected isConnected} method to determine
if the connection is still alive.
Some older servers return the wrong response code on success, some
servers don't implement the NOOP command at all and so always return
a failure code.  Set this property to false to handle servers
that are broken in this way.
Normally, when a server times out a connection, it will send a 421
response code, which the client will see as the response to the next
command it issues.
Some servers send the wrong failure response code when timing out a
connection.
Do not set this property to false when dealing with servers that are
broken in this way.
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
In general, applications should not need to use the classes in this
package directly.  Instead, they should use the APIs defined by
<code>javax.mail</code> package (and subpackages).  Applications should
never construct instances of <code>SMTPTransport</code> directly.
Instead, they should use the
<code>Session</code> method <code>getTransport</code> to acquire an
appropriate <code>Transport</code> object.
<P>
In addition to printing debugging output as controlled by the
{@link javax.mail.Session Session} configuration,
the com.sun.mail.smtp provider logs the same information using
