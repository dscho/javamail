Classes specific to Internet mail systems.
This package supports features that are specific to Internet mail systems
based on the MIME standard
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2045</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2046</A>, and
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2047</A>).
The IMAP, SMTP, and POP3 protocols use
{@link javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage MimeMessages}.
<P>
The JavaMail API specification requires support for the following properties,
which must be set in the <code>System</code> properties.
The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes
how the string is interpreted.  For example, use (in J2SE 1.2 and newer)
<PRE>
	System.setProperty("mail.mime.address.strict", "false");
</PRE>
to set the <CODE>mail.mime.address.strict</CODE> property,
which is of type boolean.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER>

<TH>Name</TH>
<TH>Type</TH>
<TH>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.address.strict</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The <code>mail.mime.address.strict</code> session property controls
the parsing of address headers.  By default, strict parsing of address
headers is done.  If this property is set to <code>"false"</code>,
strict parsing is not done and many illegal addresses that sometimes
occur in real messages are allowed.  See the <code>InternetAddress</code>
class for details.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.charset</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
The <code>mail.mime.charset</code> System property can
be used to specify the default MIME charset to use for encoded words
and text parts that don't otherwise specify a charset.  Normally, the
default MIME charset is derived from the default Java charset, as
specified in the <code>file.encoding</code> System property.  Most
applications will have no need to explicitly set the default MIME
charset.  In cases where the default MIME charset to be used for
mail messages is different than the charset used for files stored on
the system, this property should be set.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.decodetext.strict</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The <code>mail.mime.decodetext.strict</code> property controls
decoding of MIME encoded words.  The MIME spec requires that encoded
words start at the beginning of a whitespace separated word.  Some
mailers incorrectly include encoded words in the middle of a word.
If the <code>mail.mime.decodetext.strict</code> System property is
set to <code>"false"</code>, an attempt will be made to decode these
illegal encoded words. The default is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.encodeeol.strict</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The <code>mail.mime.encodeeol.strict</code> property controls the
choice of Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME parts that are not of
type "text".  Often such parts will contain textual data for which
an encoding that allows normal end of line conventions is appropriate.
In rare cases, such a part will appear to contain entirely textual
data, but will require an encoding that preserves CR and LF characters
without change.  If the <code>mail.mime.encodeeol.strict</code>
System property is set to <code>"true"</code>, such an encoding will
be used when necessary.  The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.decodefilename</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, the <code>getFileName</code> method
uses the <code>MimeUtility</code>
method <code>decodeText</code> to decode any
non-ASCII characters in the filename.  Note that this decoding
violates the MIME specification, but is useful for interoperating
with some mail clients that use this convention.
The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.encodefilename</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, the <code>setFileName</code> method
uses the <code>MimeUtility</code>
method <code>encodeText</code> to encode any
non-ASCII characters in the filename.  Note that this encoding
violates the MIME specification, but is useful for interoperating
with some mail clients that use this convention.
The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.decodeparameters</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, non-ASCII parameters in a
<code>ParameterList</code>, e.g., in a Content-Type header,
will be decoded as specified by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2231.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2231</A>.
The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.encodeparameters</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, non-ASCII parameters in a
<code>ParameterList</code>, e.g., in a Content-Type header,
will be encoded as specified by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2231.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2231</A>.
The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.multipart. ignoremissingendboundary</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Normally, when parsing a multipart MIME message, a message that is
missing the final end boundary line is not considered an error.
The data simply ends at the end of the input.  Note that messages
of this form violate the MIME specification.  If the property
<code>mail.mime.multipart.ignoremissingendboundary</code> is set
to <code>false</code>, such messages are considered an error and a
<code>MesagingException</code> will be thrown when parsing such a
message.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.multipart. ignoremissingboundaryparameter</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If the Content-Type header for a multipart content does not have
a <code>boundary</code> parameter, the multipart parsing code
will look for the first line in the content that looks like a
boundary line and extract the boundary parameter from the line.
If this property is set to <code>"false"</code>, a
<code>MessagingException</code> will be thrown if the Content-Type
header doesn't specify a boundary parameter.
The default is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.multipart. ignoreexistingboundaryparameter</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Normally the boundary parameter in the Content-Type header of a multipart
body part is used to specify the separator between parts of the multipart
body.  This System property may be set to <code>"true"</code> to cause
the parser to look for a line in the multipart body that looks like a
boundary line and use that value as the separator between subsequent parts.
This may be useful in cases where a broken anti-virus product has rewritten
the message incorrectly such that the boundary parameter and the actual
boundary value no longer match.
The default value of this property is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.multipart. allowempty</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Normally, when writing out a MimeMultipart that contains no body
parts, or when trying to parse a multipart message with no body parts,
a <code>MessagingException</code> is thrown.  The MIME spec does not allow
multipart content with no body parts.  This
System property may be set to <code>"true"</code> to override this behavior.
When writing out such a MimeMultipart, a single empty part will be
included.  When reading such a multipart, a MimeMultipart will be created
with no body parts.
The default value of this property is false.
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>



<P>
The following properties are supported by Sun's implementation of
JavaMail, but are not currently a required part of the specification.
As above, these must be set as <CODE>System</CODE> properties.
The names, types, defaults, and semantics of these properties may
change in future releases.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER>

<TH>Name</TH>
<TH>Type</TH>
<TH>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.base64.ignoreerrors</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, the BASE64 decoder will ignore errors
in the encoded data, returning EOF.  This may be useful when dealing
with improperly encoded messages that contain extraneous data at the
end of the encoded stream.  Note however that errors anywhere in the
stream will cause the decoder to stop decoding so this should be used
with extreme caution.  The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.foldtext</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, header fields containing just text
such as the <code>Subject</code> and <code>Content-Description</code>
header fields, and long parameter values in structured headers such
as <code>Content-Type</code> will be folded (broken into 76 character lines)
when set and unfolded when read.  The default is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.setcontenttypefilename</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, the <code>setFileName</code> method
will also set the <code>name</code> parameter on the <code>Content-Type</code>
header to the specified filename.  This supports interoperability with
some old mail clients.  The default is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.setdefaulttextcharset</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
When updating the headers of a message, a body
part with a <code>text</code> content type but no <code>charset</code>
parameter will have a <code>charset</code> parameter added to it
if this property is set to <code>"true"</code>.
The default is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.parameters.strict</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to false, when reading a message, parameter values in header fields
such as <code>Content-Type</code> and <code>Content-Disposition</code>
are allowed to contain whitespace and other special characters without
being quoted; the parameter value ends at the next semicolon.
If set to true (the default), parameter values are required to conform
to the MIME specification and must be quoted if they contain whitespace
or special characters.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.applefilenames</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Apple Mail incorrectly encodes filenames that contain spaces,
forgetting to quote the parameter value.  If this property is
set to <code>"true"</code>, JavaMail will try to detect this
situation when parsing parameters and work around it.
The default is false.
Note that this property handles a subset of the cases handled
by setting the mail.mime.parameters.strict property to false.
This property will likely be removed in a future release.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.windowsfilenames</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Internet Explorer 6 incorrectly includes a complete pathname
in the filename parameter of the Content-Disposition header
for uploaded files, and fails to properly escape the backslashes
in the pathname.  If this property is
set to <code>"true"</code>, JavaMail will preserve all backslashes
in the "filename" and "name" parameters of any MIME header.
The default is false.
Note that this is a violation of the MIME specification but may
be useful when using JavaMail to parse HTTP messages for uploaded
files sent by IE6.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime. ignoreunknownencoding</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, an unknown value in the
<code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header will be ignored
when reading a message and an encoding of "8bit" will be assumed.
If set to <code>"false"</code>, an exception is thrown for an
unknown encoding value.  The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.uudecode. ignoreerrors</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, errors in the encoded format of a
uuencoded document will be ignored when reading a message part.
If set to <code>"false"</code>, an exception is thrown for an
incorrectly encoded message part.  The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.uudecode. ignoremissingbeginend</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, a missing "being" or "end" line in a
uuencoded document will be ignored when reading a message part.
If set to <code>"false"</code>, an exception is thrown for a
uuencoded message part without the required "begin" and "end" lines.
The default is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime. ignorewhitespacelines</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Normally the header of a MIME part is separated from the body by an empty
line.  This System property may be set to <code>"true"</code> to cause
the parser to consider a line containing only whitespace to be an empty
line.  The default value of this property is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime. ignoremultipartencoding</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The MIME spec does not allow body parts of type multipart/* to be encoded.
The Content-Transfer-Encoding header is ignored in this case.
Setting this System property to <code>"false"</code> will
cause the Content-Transfer-Encoding header to be honored for multipart
content.
The default value of this property is true.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.allowencodedmessages</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The MIME spec does not allow body parts of type message/* to be encoded.
The Content-Transfer-Encoding header is ignored in this case.
Some versions of Microsoft Outlook will incorrectly encode message
attachments.  Setting this System property to <code>"true"</code> will
cause the Content-Transfer-Encoding header to be honored for message
attachments.
The default value of this property is false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.mime.contenttypehandler</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
In some cases JavaMail is unable to process messages with an invalid
Content-Type header.  The header may have incorrect syntax or other
problems.  This property specifies the name of a class that will be
used to clean up the Content-Type header value before JavaMail uses it.
The class must have a method with this signature:
<CODE>public static String cleanContentType(MimePart mp, String contentType)</CODE>
Whenever JavaMail accesses the Content-Type header of a message, it
will pass the value to this method and use the returned value instead.
The value may be null if the Content-Type header isn't present.
Returning null will cause the default Content-Type to be used.
The MimePart may be used to access other headers of the message part
to determine how to correct the Content-Type.
Note that the Content-Type handler doesn't affect the
<CODE>getHeader</CODE> method, which still returns the raw header value.
Note also that the handler doesn't affect the IMAP provider; the IMAP
server is responsible for returning pre-parsed, syntactically correct
Content-Type information.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.alternates</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
A string containing other email addresses that the current user is known by.
The <code>MimeMessage</code> <code>reply</code> method will eliminate any
of these addresses from the recipient list in the message it constructs,
to avoid sending the reply back to the sender.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.replyallcc</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to <code>"true"</code>, the <code>MimeMessage</code>
<code>reply</code> method will put all recipients except the original
sender in the <code>Cc</code> list of the newly constructed message.
Normally, recipients in the <code>To</code> header of the original
message will also appear in the <code>To</code> list of the newly
constructed message.
